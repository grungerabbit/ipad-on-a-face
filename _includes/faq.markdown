### Will iPad on a Face<sup>TM</sup> integrate with services such as Amazon Mechanical Turk?

Laboratory tests by our Research and Development scientists indicate that you can source any rando off the street. However, while weA.N.A.L.<sup>TM</sup> (we Are Not A Laywer<sup>TM</sup>), paying nameless workers fractions of a cent may be an even better strategy. We have heard reports that some prefer their labor to be anonymous and as slavey as possible. 

Please consult your legal counsel. Last we checked, that's only legal in Nevada.
